This repository contains the base README for a simple chicken dance web app.

The goal is to build a React application that displays a dancing chicken using three.js and styled via Tailwind CSS.

### Development Notes
- Initialize a React project (e.g. Create React App or Vite).
- Install Tailwind CSS following official docs; configure PostCSS/Tailwind config files.
- Add three.js to render a 3D chicken model. A simple rigged model can be loaded and animated (glTF recommended).
- Main page should show the chicken doing a looping dance animation.
- Ensure the layout is responsive and visually delightful with Tailwind.

### Workflow Steps
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Implement React components for layout and the three.js canvas.
3. Use Tailwind utility classes for styling.
4. Load a three.js chicken model, animate it, and embed in the page.
5. Provide start script `npm start` for development server, and `npm run build` for production.

### Testing
- Lint code with standard React linter settings.
- Optionally add simple React tests to verify components render.
